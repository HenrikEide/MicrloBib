# Intro


This is a mock component library for documenting components for a particular project. It is a personal project I made mostly just to try out [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

:::warning

This is unofficial work in progress, and exists mainly as a proof of concept.

## Design

### Colors

The client has an extensive catalogue of colors used in their branding:

- Red


## Component details

The components are written in React, with Typescript and Tailwind CSS. Beyond this no external libraries are needed, just copy paste them into your project.


### Requirements

- React ^19.0.0
- Typescript ^5.0.0
- Tailwindcss ^3.4.0
